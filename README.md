# API Challenge
This homework is intended to challenge the use of APIs, specically OpenWeatherData and Google Developer. Through two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy, I called APIs and created a series of visualizations to answer the big question - Where should I vacation this summer?

### WeatherPy Analysis
1. While there is no strong correlation between humidity and latitude, humidity does have less variance around the equator.

2. Temperate increased along the equator, but does remain slightly higher in the southern hemisphere.

3. It is likely that cloudiness is reported in increments of 10. With more specific and targeted data, we may be able to see a more consistent relationship, which is not currently present.
